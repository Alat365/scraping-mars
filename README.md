# In this week's challenge, I mainly utilized lectures and previous activities in order to develop my code. I had not previously used the 'to_datetime' function to change the datatype to a date format so I had to go online to see how to use it before implementing it in my code. As a side note, I decided to add the webdriver_manager.chrome module as it was what we had used in class to open the browser.
